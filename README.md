This is a bot for Discord that uses [OpenAI's Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) (a.k.a. ChatGPT) to have conversations with members in a server.

Model support currently includes [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) and [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) (`gpt-4`).

## üìú Background

I simply made this because it seems like every other developer is experimenting with AI right now, and since [OpenAI recently announced their chat completion API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), I thought now is probably a better time than never. There's no other motiviation behind this than just wanting an excuse to play around with ChatGPT from a development view.

## üì• Usage

**NOTE: [OpenAI's Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) is not free, though still quite cheap, and thus requires setting up a recurring billing account.**

**NOTE: The [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) model is currently in a limited beta, if you have not been granted access then your Discord server members will only be able to use the [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) model.**
