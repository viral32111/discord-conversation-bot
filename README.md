# Discord Conversation Bot

This is a bot for Discord that uses [OpenAI's Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) (a.k.a. ChatGPT, GPT 3.5 Turbo) to have conversations with members in a server.

## Background

I simply made this because it seems like every other developer is experimenting with AI right now, and since [OpenAI recently announced their chat completion API](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis), I thought now is probably a better time than never. There's no other motiviation behind this than just wanting an excuse to play around with ChatGPT from a development view.
